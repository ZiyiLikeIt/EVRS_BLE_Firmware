# EVRS_BLE_FIRMWARE (moved to new repos, EBS and ETX)
The CCS project for Transmitter and Basestation prototype in EVRS, using launchxl-cc2650.

The Electronic Voting Response System (EVRS) is our capstone project topic in UoM, it mainly contains multiple transmitter(TX) using CC2650 and a base station(BS) using Raspberry PI 3B+. The wireless communication protocol would be chosen from BLE, Zigbee and 6LowPAN.

This project is the source code for the transmitter and basestation prototype using launchxl-cc2650 evaluation board. Development would be based on the TI-RTOS real time system.
